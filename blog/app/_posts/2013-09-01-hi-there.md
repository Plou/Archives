#Hi there!

Since I left school a couple of years ago I try to use what I studied, which is mostly to be **curious**, every day at work. As a web developer, I'm learning as I work and build stuff.

It happens fast, our tools improves, workflow evolves and devices used to access *websites* changed a **lot** in the past few years. We're not even doing only websites anymore (things like webApps came out)!

To formalize my understanding of web design & development I'll use this media. Writing about things I learned, how I work and some of the amazing stuff I found out there, will help me to achieve a better understanding.

Because it is a great place to do so, I'll use it as a playground to experiment stuff. Kept free from clients constrains I'll enjoy using new stuff to build it. Sorry if your not using the same browser as meâ€¦ I'll work on that soon.

I'm glad you came by, I hope you'll find something of any help to you.

There will be soon some articles about web design, programming and how I learned stuff building this website.

Meanwhile you should go read them : **Addy Osmani** & **Brad Frost** 

See you later,<br />
