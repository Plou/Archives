#Anybody's here ?
Anyone making a great thing want to share it with the world, most of them at least.

The first time you let your creation go outside to meet the world, you may feel uneasy about it. As an overprotective parent, you want it to be safe.

So you go looking for a licence, either you don't want your product to be edited/shared freely or you want it as free as possible.

That’s when I felt lost. Making a choice between all ’open-sources’ licenses out there is not what you call easy... But it could be !

On [Choose a licence](http://choosealicense.com/) you can find sums up of all main licences with a human readable list about what each require, permit and forbid. Then you can go further and read the licence text to check if it’s the one.

Good luck and enjoy your trip to licensing wonderland!
