# An auto-replicant presentation

This week I had the opportunity to make a presentation about Yeoman and how it will improve our workflow at [Inouit](http://www.inouit.fr).

The purpose of this presentation is to introduce tools to improve the development workflow while using them to building slides with yeoman.

You can read the [slides](http://plou.github.io/slides/yeoman-modern-workflow/en/) [FR](http://plou.github.io/slides/yeoman-modern-workflow/fr/) and access the [sources](https://github.com/Plou/Slides/tree/master/yeoman-modern-workflow).
